# tf-idf-search-engine
A term frequency-inverse document frequency search engine proof of concept written in Python.

Files used in testing are omitted, and development on this project has stopped.
However, I plan on using what I learned in this project to develop my search-recommend-engine (https://github.com/haosenli/search-recommend-engine).
